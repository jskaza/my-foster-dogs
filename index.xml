I made this site so that I can have a place to share all the dogs, each with their own story, who have given me unconditional love. I hope I made each of their lives a bit better.

She loved exploring trails and slept in the bed, no crate necessary. I was even able to let her off-leash in an open field.</description></item><item><title>Brody</title><link>https://jskaza.github.io/my-foster-dogs/dogs/brody/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jskaza.github.io/my-foster-dogs/dogs/brody/</guid><description>Meet Brody, the cutest 3-month-old puppy in foster care! Brody is a pit bull and lab mix.
This lovable little pup is full of energy and loves to play. He&amp;rsquo;s always alternating between taking naps and playing with his favorite toys, especially chewable toys and bones. He&amp;rsquo;s currently in the final stages of his potty training and working on teething and chewing household items. But with a little patience and guidance, Brody is sure to become the perfect companion.</description></item><item><title>Bubbles</title><link>https://jskaza.github.io/my-foster-dogs/dogs/bubbles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jskaza.github.io/my-foster-dogs/dogs/bubbles/</guid><description>Bubbles (a.k.a. &amp;ldquo;Bubs&amp;rdquo;) is a bundle of joy. She has quickly adapted to life in a home. Bubs knows better than to take care of her business indoors and learned how to &amp;ldquo;sit&amp;rdquo; in only a day or two! She is starting to outgrow her puppy phase, though she does engage in some harmless nipping every once in a while.
Bubs is very adaptable. She may be nervous in a new environment or may whine when in her crate, but these moments are fleeting.</description></item><item><title>Kelly</title><link>https://jskaza.github.io/my-foster-dogs/dogs/kelly/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jskaza.github.io/my-foster-dogs/dogs/kelly/</guid><description>Upon meeting Kelly, I could sense that she was nervous and perhaps had even possessed some sort of trauma. She was hesitant to follow me certain places (particularly upstairs or into the car), kept her tail down, and even seemed a bit “pee shy” (she’d only go once or twice a day). However, during her first few days with me, Kelly was very friendly, just a bit nervous. I’ve never had any issues with her displaying aggression.</description></item><item><title>Samson</title><link>https://jskaza.github.io/my-foster-dogs/dogs/samson/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jskaza.github.io/my-foster-dogs/dogs/samson/</guid><description>I only had Samson for one night. He is best described as a lovable beefcake. He was very well-behaved and got along well with other dogs. Everybody at the dog park adored him.</description></item></channel></rss>
