Meet Brody, the cutest 3-month-old puppy in foster care! Brody is a pit bull and lab mix.

This lovable little pup is full of energy and loves to play. He's always alternating between taking naps and playing with his favorite toys, especially chewable toys and bones. He's currently in the final stages of his potty training and working on teething
 and chewing household items. But with a little patience and guidance, Brody is sure to become the perfect companion.

Brody loves nothing more than snuggling up with his humans at night. He's amazing with all people and dogs, and his friendly nature makes him a joy to be around.

If you're looking for a playful and adorable companion to add to your family, Brody is the one for you. He's waiting patiently for his forever home and can't wait to shower you with love and affection.
