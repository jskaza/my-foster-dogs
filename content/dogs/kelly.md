Upon meeting Kelly, I could sense that she was nervous and perhaps had even possessed some sort of trauma. She was hesitant to follow me certain places (particularly upstairs or into the car), kept her tail down, and even seemed a bit “pee shy” (she’d only go once or twice a day). However, during her first few days with me, Kelly was very friendly, just a bit nervous. I’ve never had any issues with her displaying aggression.

After these first few days, Kelly started to come out of her shell. If we fast forward to today, Kelly is confident, playful, happy, and loving. She goes up the stairs on her own accord, hops right up into the car if we need to go somewhere, is always wagging her tail, and pees whenever we go outside. I am so proud of her and the progress that she has made. Personally, I can say that she is one of the best dogs I have ever been around. She has an incredibly even temperament, is completely house-trained, plays well with other dogs, has mastered basic commands (“sit” and “down”), and can be left on her own. Overall, she’s just an amazing dog and companion. 

Kelly loves long walks and hikes, and I think it is important that her future parent(s) make sure to provide her with lots of exercise. I think having a fenced-in yard to run around in would be great for her. She is great with all people—children and adults. Sometimes, it takes her a few minutes to warm up to a new person, but soon enough she’ll be on her back looking for a belly rub. 

My favorite trait of Kelly’s is her loyalty. If you treat her with compassion, she will be the most loving friend you could ask for. I always feel proud when Kelly is playing with dogs and she immediately comes to me if I call her name. She also “checks in” with me every once in a while as if to make sure she can keep playing! I think it is so adorable.
