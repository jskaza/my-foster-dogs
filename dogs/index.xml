She loved exploring trails and slept in the bed, no crate necessary. I was even able to let her off-leash in an open field.</description></item><item><title>Bubbles</title><link>https://jskaza.github.io/my-foster-dogs/dogs/bubbles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jskaza.github.io/my-foster-dogs/dogs/bubbles/</guid><description>Bubbles (a.k.a. &amp;ldquo;Bubs&amp;rdquo;) is a bundle of joy. She has quickly adapted to life in a home. Bubs knows better than to take care of her business indoors and learned how to &amp;ldquo;sit&amp;rdquo; in only a day or two! She is starting to outgrow her puppy phase, though she does engage in some harmless nipping every once in a while.
Bubs is very adaptable. She may be nervous in a new environment or may whine when in her crate, but these moments are fleeting.</description></item><item><title>Samson</title><link>https://jskaza.github.io/my-foster-dogs/dogs/samson/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jskaza.github.io/my-foster-dogs/dogs/samson/</guid><description>I only has Samson for one night. He is best described as a lovable beefcake. He was very well-behaved and got along well with other dogs. Everybody at the dog park adored him.</description></item></channel></rss>
